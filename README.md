## **Introduction**

### **Aims**
This project aims to use the Iris dataset to demonstrate different analysis using Python with the level of skills acquired during the course. I show the research and exploration done on the dataset and, as a result, display/render the data to better understand the data within it, the differences, and how they compare. 

### **Iris flowers**

Iris is the largest genus of the family Iridaceae with up to 300 species. [Plants of the World Online](https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:326330-2) lists 312 accepted species from this genus as of 2024. 
In general, the Iris’ meaning is sent to present faith, hope and wisdom, but it can vary depending on the variety and colour of the flowers.
These classic flowers derive their name from the Greek goddess of the rainbow and come in a stunning array of vibrant colours.

### **Iris flower data set**

Three of Iris varieties (_Iris Setosa_, _Iris Virginica_ and _Iris Versicolor_) are used in the [Iris flower data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)  outlined by the British statistician and biologist [Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) in his 1936 paper [The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems](https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/15227/1/138.pdf) as an example of linear discriminant analysis.

The data set consist of 50 samples from each of three species, representing a total of 150 observation. Four attributes are measured from each sample: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The measurement was made in centimetres.

## **Investigation**

### **Set up**

We need to set up environment to be able to write and run the code for any analysis we want to explore.

I would suggest using below programs:
* [Visual studio code (VSC)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) – is a free, open-source code editor used for coding.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) – is a general-purpose programming language, not specialized for any specific problems, and used to create a various program.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - it is a repository that helps developers store, manage track, and make a change to their codes.
